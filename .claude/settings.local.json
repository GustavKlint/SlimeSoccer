      "Bash(git commit -m \"Add googly eyes and increase difficulty (v1.3.0)\n\n- Added physics-based googly eyes that track the ball\n- Eyes have momentum and spring physics for realistic movement\n- Increased slime speed (2 -> 2.5) and jump power (6 -> 7)\n- Increased ball gravity (0.025 -> 0.035) for faster gameplay\n- Higher max velocity (8 -> 10) with less damping\n- Stronger base collision force (3.0 -> 3.5)\n- Faster overall gravity (0.25 -> 0.3)\n- Game is now significantly more challenging and fast-paced\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\")",
